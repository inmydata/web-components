A suite of components, making it effortless to embed inmydata visualisations & dashboards, and provide AI conversational ability to your application.

Our components are simple HTML elements, based on the universally supported [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) standard.  They are vanilla JavaScript with no dependencies, and can be used in any web page, with or without a framework.  Regardless of whether you use React, Angular, jQuery, any other framework, or no framework at all, you can easily embed elements of inmydata to your application. 

## Components
 - `<inmydata-copilot/>` (For AI conversations)
 - `<inmydata-vis/>` (To embed a saved visualisation, or the visualisation builder, or show a Copilot chart)
 - `<inmydata-dashboard/>` (To embed a dashboard)
 - `<inmydata-insights/>` (To show a list of Insights)
 - `<inmydata-aichart/>` (To show a chart produced by an AI conversation, e.g. LiveKit)

## Getting Started
To use our components in your web application, add one line to your html:

`<script src="https://sdk.inmydata.ai/inmydata-components-all.min.js"/>`

Or you may wish to download the components from the `dist` folder here and self-host.
